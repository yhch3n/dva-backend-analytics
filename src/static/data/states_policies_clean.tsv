Roy Cooper’s (D) reopening plan, which is expected to begin June 26. Under a revised version of the bill, Cooper would be able to re-close those businesses if the number of coronavirus cases should increase if he has agreement from the Council of State. Cooper vetoed a similar bill, House Bill 536, which would have allowed bars and restaurants to temporarily expand service to outdoor spaces, explaining that the bill would have limited officials' ability to close establishments should there be another surge in the pandemic.
